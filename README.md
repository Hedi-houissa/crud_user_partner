# Getting Started with Create React App

This app is a web application that allows users to manage their partners. The backend of the app is built using Node.js and JWT for authentication, while the frontend is built using React.js. The app uses a MySQL database to store user and partner data.

Users can log in to the app using their email and password. Once authenticated, they are redirected to a dashboard page that displays stats and charts about their partners, including the total number of partners, and the increase or decrease of partners over time.
